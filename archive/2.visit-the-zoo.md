### When you fell like you've got the hang of it:

**Challenges** ( Or create something crazy that you think of yourself! )

- [ ] Make a cat that you can move using the arrow keys
- [ ] Make a mouse that disappears when the cat touches it
- [ ] Every time a mouse is caught a new mouse appears in a random location
- [ ] Make the mouse run away randomly (easy), from the cat (harder)
- [ ] Make a score variable (in data section)
- [ ] Make the score change by 1 every time you catch a mouse (using costumes)
- [ ] Animate the cat and mouse
- [ ] Compose your own music to play during the game
- [ ] Create a time limit of 30 seconds
- [ ] Create a high score variable that saves the highest score
