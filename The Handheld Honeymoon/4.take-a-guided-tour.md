# Take a guided tour

Now that you've chosen a language it's time to get the basics down. It's time to get a guided tour and take some pictures.

- Create a cheat sheet for yourself as you do the tutorial (take some pictures!)

# Take some pictures

## Take some notes on the basics

While you're doing your first tutorial it's a good idea to take some notes. It's better for retention and you also create a cheat sheet for yourself so you don't have to look everything up.

## For each concept write down:

1. What is it?
2. What does it look like in this programming language
3. What is it used for?

## Basics concepts that are in almost any programming language:

**Note: many concepts do not apply if you're studying HTML/CSS**
