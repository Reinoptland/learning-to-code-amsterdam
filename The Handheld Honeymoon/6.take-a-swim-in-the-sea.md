# Take a swim in the Sea

Remixing a javascript game is diving right in! Javascript is more challenging
than HTML/CSS because it is easier to make syntax errors and break your code.
In addition, this game contains loops, conditional statements and functions
which you might be using for the first time.

Remixing a Javascript game without any knowledge of javascript can be
challenging. But you can achieve most challenges by changing values and copying
and pasting from other parts of the program. Solutions to the challenges are provided below each set of challenges. Good luck!

We are going to modify an existing javascript game called Fruitdrop. It was designed by Robrecht Jurriaans (CTO of Bomberbot) You can find it this url:

https://thimbleprojects.org/reinoptland/354675

The first step is to press the "Remix" to get a version of the code for you to edit

There are two script files. p5.play.js and sketch.js. The game logic is in sketch.js so we will be modifying that.

### P5 Library

The p5.play.js file is a library. A library is a collection of functions written by other programmers that we can use. By using libraries we don't have to start programming from scratch. The p5.js libraries contains all kinds of functions for games, animations, drawing and music. This specific one p5.play, provides sprites, animations, input and collision functions for games and gamelike applications.

You can find the p5.play.js documentation here:
