### Before starting to work on the actual project have a conversation:

- Tell each other a little bit about yourself  
- Explain why each of you want to make a website  

### Let's do some planning:

- Exchange phone numbers and email addresses  
- Set up 4 meetings to work on the project:  
  - The date and the time  
  - Where to meet up  

### Here is an outline you can follow to make the project

1. **Goal identification:**  
Determine the goals the site needs to fulfill. I.e., what its purpose is.
2. **Scope definition:**  
Once we know the site's goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what pages and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out. If this is your first project: keep it simple.
3. **Sitemap and wireframe creation:**   
With the scope well-defined, make a map of the different pages of your site. Sketch a simple design for each page (this is called wireframing, you can look up some examples for inspiration).
4. **Content creation:**  
Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating the individual pages using only HTML. Donâ€™t worry if you site looks really basic or if the content is not in the right place yet.  
5. **Visual style:**  
With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual style. Use CSS to improve the layout of your HTML to match your initial design. Add some colors and fonts to make your site unique!  
6. **Deploy:**  
Once everything's looking pretty, it's time to deploy your site and put it on the internet for people to see!  
7. **Celebrate the success of your project with your teammate.**

### Tools you can use:

- http://thimble.mozilla.org/ is an online editor to make websites and deploy websites without any setup - great for beginners. Some downsides: your site can only be 5MB and it will not have pretty url.
- Atom is a free, professional code editor and a gives you much more control than thimble. If you use Atom you will have to deploy your site yourself. Here is shortened url to a tutorial: https://bit.ly/2EuffJO
- An easy way to deploy a website is github pages. The only thing you need is a free github account. Here is shortened url to a tutorial: https://bit.ly/2qeZQcb
- You can also use netlify drop to quickly deploy your website

**Have fun and be excellent to your teammate!**
